Warning: You should always be careful for what you install with phoronix-test-suite.

This project was something I only did to learn how to make pts.

Anyone wanting to test this out you need to copy the repo's folder talos-principle into your 
~/.phoronix-test-suite/test-profiles/local/ and folder.

Open xml file downloads.xml and edit <URL>file://home/user</URL> user out with your username.

From here you should be able to run it with command
  phoronix-test-suite run local/talos-principle
  
  
What's the difference with this test, then avalible https://openbenchmarking.org/test/pts/talos-principle-1.2.0?
Few flaws:
  * Unskippable intro (BUG: even if you set men_bShowIntroCutscene = 0; it will ignore it)
  * Warning message (Outdated drivers or start in safemode after bad exit)
  * Does *somtimes* interfere with users configuration

This pts fixes that, thanks to hook.c. 
hook.c tells the software where to read the user configuration and only give it read-only permission.

Granted, with my C programming knowledge you can easily see bad coding (I am still learning).
